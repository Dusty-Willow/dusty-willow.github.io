							<p>This Snake Game was built for Panda Hub Inc. and their website. It was made for the purpose of increasing user retention, as well as to allow users to earn discount codes for the company's services. I was the sole person responsible for implementation and debugging, as well
							as making sure the game was responsive to different devices.</p> 
							
							<p></p>The game itself was implemented using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. The game utilizes a grid-based system with values for each cell of the grid corresponding to a 2-Dimensional array. It also incorporates a scaling difficulty 
							system based on how many points a user has earned, increasing the speed of the snake as that score value increases.	The game also accounts for varying dimensions of device screens, enabling the game to function correctly on a 
							multitude of devices. Additionally, the game also incorporates on-screen controls for users on mobile devices or tablets.</p>
